# C Programming
25 years ago I learned C as my first real programming language in University. Since then I've done a lot of things, and some programming... but not much C. So I'm relearning it.

I've got fond memories of building data structures like linked lists and binary trees from scratch using pointers and getting extremely frustrated when they weren't working, only to feel absolutely Godly when I finally got them up and running. I'm hoping for more of the Godly and less of the frustration this time around.

As I move on to or use other resources I'll include them here. I'm not sure it will be of any use to anyone, but I figured there was no reason to hide either.
